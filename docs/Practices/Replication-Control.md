  title: Replication Control
  objective: Preventing self-replicating AI or unsupervised proliferation by implementing strict replication oversight and distribution controls.
  mitigates:
    - reference-id: loss-of-human-control
      reason: Preventing unsupervised AI proliferation maintains human control over AI deployment
    - reference-id: emergent-behaviour
      reason: Preventing unsupervised proliferation of emergent behaviours by implementing strict replication oversight

- Replication control becomes relevant when an AI system can duplicate itself—or be duplicated—beyond the reach of any central authority (analogous to a computer virus—though with potentially far greater autonomy and adaptability).  

- An organization/person builds a very capable AI with some misaligned objectives. If they distribute its model or code openly, it effectively becomes “in the wild.”

- Could controls be put in place to prevent this from happening? TODO: figure this out.

- In open-source communities or decentralised systems, controlling replication requires broad consensus and technical enforcement measures.
