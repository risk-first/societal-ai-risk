  mitigates:
    - reference-id: synthetic-intelligence-rivalry
      reason: By involving multiple stakeholders, concentration of the gains from AI can be shared across civilisation
    - reference-id: loss-of-diversity
      reason: Prevents monopolisation by ensuring governance involves multiple institutions
    - reference-id: unintended-cascading-failures
      reason: Real-time monitoring to detect anomalies before they cascade
