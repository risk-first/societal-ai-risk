- Equip citizens with media literacy skills to spot deepfakes and manipulation attempts.

- Encourage public understanding of how personal data can be exploited by AI-driven systems.

- While public outreach is feasible, achieving wide coverage and sustained engagement can be resource-intensive.  Overcoming entrenched biases, misinformation echo chambers, and public apathy is an uphill battle, particularly if there’s no supportive policy or consistent funding.
