# Societal AI Risk Framework

A risk framework addressing **societal-level risks** due to Artificial Intelligence (AI). This was developed for discussion in the AI Risks chapter of the [Risk-First Software Development](https://riskfirst.org/Risk-First-Second-Edition) book.

If you want a much more comprehensive view of what is going on in the world of risk management for AI, please take a look at the [MIT AI Risks Database](https://airisk.mit.edu) which covers hundreds of different AI Risk Frameworks. One of the reasons for such proliferation is that there are many different domains that are impacted by AI.

Here, we are narrowly considering a broad "society" level domain.

## Outcomes

- Understand the main risks we face as society nurturing AI.
- Understand which risks can be managed (i.e. have mitigating practices), which perhaps can't.
